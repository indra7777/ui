                                    machine, which makes it semi-automate to

                                        In a traditional way of packing bottles,
                                        a cover is used to pack a stack of
                                        bottles to
                                        transport from the bottle
                                        production plant to the filling station.
                                        After reaching the filling station, the
                                        cover
                                        is cut off and it cannot be
                                        reused because of tearing. Wooden boxes
                                        are not used because returning the boxes
                                        increases transportation cost. So
                                        design a new way of packing that
