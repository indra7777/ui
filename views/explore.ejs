                In a radial drilling machine, accurately determining the depth
                of the hole while drilling can be challenging. The goal is to

                drilling machine, enabling it to semi-automatically control and

              <p>
                Parents today are increasingly concerned about the safety and
                well-being of their children, especially regarding school
                attendance and safety during playtime in designated areas. We
                are seeking innovative proposals for a system that can track a
                child&apos;s school attendance and monitor their location during
                play. The system should feature:
              </p>

              <h6 class="fw-bold">Boundary Alert System:</h6>
              <p>
                Define a specific safety boundary (e.g., 100 meters) around the
                child&apos;s play area, with an alert system that notifies
                parents if the child crosses this boundary.
              </p>
              <h6 class="fw-bold">Parental Notifications:</h6>
              <p>
                Real-time alerts should be sent to parents via a mobile app or
                SMS, informing them if the child misses school or leaves the
                designated play area.
              </p>
              <h6 class="fw-bold">Mobile App/Web Dashboard:</h6>
              <p>
                A user-friendly mobile app for parents to receive alerts and
                track their child&apos;s attendance and location, along with a
                detailed web dashboard that provides comprehensive reports and
                settings.
              </p>
              <h6 class="fw-bold">Emergency Contact Integration:</h6>
              <p>
                Include an emergency contact feature within the app, allowing
                parents to respond quickly to alerts or emergencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the solution must ensure full compliance with
                privacy laws and regulations regarding children&apos;s data,
                implement strong security measures to protect sensitive
                information, and provide clear communication to parents
                regarding the system&apos;s purpose and functionality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We challenge innovators to create a robust, scalable, and secure
                system that addresses these key safety and tracking concerns,
                providing peace of mind to parents and guardians.

                We are facing a critical issue with the third piston ring
                (3-piece oil ring), where the rail is experiencing deformation
                during the heat treatment process. This deformation, resulting
                in bending, is causing the ring to be rejected as it no longer
                meets the required standards for functionality and fitment. The
                rings are intended for use in engines that run on 85% Ethanol
                fuel (flex fuel) in BS-VI motorcycles and scooters. The
                challenge is to refine the heat treatment parameters and
                manufacturing process to prevent the deformation and ensure the
                integrity of the third piston ring rail.

                A critical challenge in piston manufacturing arises from
                irregularities in the outer bore diameter following the
                finishing processes. For instance, after completing the
                finishing process, a piston with an expected diameter of 49.99
                mm experiences a reduction of 20 microns. This variation in bore
                diameter compromises the overall quality and performance of the
                piston. The goal is to develop a solution that eliminates these
                inconsistencies and ensures precise, reliable, and consistent
                bore diameters throughout the manufacturing process.
